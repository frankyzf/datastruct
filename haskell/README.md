# The Haskell Implementation of Algorithms

The `Sort` directory contains the implementation. The `sorttest.hs` is a simple
unit test. You can run `ghc sorttest.hs` to compile it.

Actually it would be cleaner to just put all sorting algorithms into a single
file, i.e. `Sort.hs`. Since this is just a practice and the algorithms are
implemented one by one, I put them in speparate files.
